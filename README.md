# OTA-PVR_Alexa
This is an Alexa skill to communicate with my USB TV tuner card connected to my PC. It allows me to send voice commands to Alexa to record TV broadcasts.

I currently am running Windows 10 Professional with a Hauppauge WINTV-HVR-995Q USB TV tuner. I wanted to create an Amazon Alexa skill that would communicate with the TV tuner card and schedule to record shows at certain times. Currently, the lambda_function.py is the lambda function that I have running on Amazon AWS and connected to my Alexa skill. Alexa will recgonize my record intent when I specify what channel I want to record on, the date, the time, and the duration (in seconds). This information is send to the other python program which is running as a server on the Windows machine with the TV tuner card. It schedules calling the WinTVRec.exe (program came with the tuner card) with the appropriate parameters. The TV channel number is that specified by the tuner card and doesn't correspond to the virtual channel number. Normally I hard code my IP address in the lambda function but I removed here. I am working on modifying the code so that the user tells Alexa his or her IP address but that part of the code is unfinished.
